# Programming with JavaScript

## How JavaScript makes pages more interactive
- Access any element from an HTML page
- Modify content
- Set steps for the browser to follow to access or change content
- Specify script to run in response to specific input

## Scripts
- A Series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal
- Write a script:
    1. Define the goal
    - determine goal you want the computer to achieve
    1. Design the script
    - split the goal into tasks
    - determine variables/information needed for each task
    - coordinate the tasks in a cohesive and ordered way
    1. Code each step

## Expressions
- evaluates into a single value
- 2 types
    - Assign a value to a variable
    - Use two or more values to return a single value

## Operators
- Assignment Operators
    - assign a value to a variable
- Arithmatic Operators
    - perform basic math
    - *Operations Availible*
    - [x] addition
    - [x] subtraction
    - [x] division
    - [x] multiplication
    - [x] increment
    - [x] decrement
    - [x] mod
- String Operators
    - combine two strings
    - combining two strings is called concatenation
    - numbers become strings when placed in quotations (`'2' vs 2`)
- Comparison Operators
    - compare two values and return boolean value
- Logical Operators
    - combine expressions and return boolean value

## Functions
- lets you group a series of statemetns together to perform a specific task
- functions require a name, and you can call it by said name
    ex: `thisIsAFunction();`
- Parameters are the information the function needs to work
- returns allow you to get a variable out of a function so it can be referenced in other places
