## Boxes:
- control dimensions
  - height and width properties control dimensions
  - pixels, percentages, or ems
  - min-width & max-width control the minimum and maxiumum sizes the image can become when the page scales
  - min-height & max-height
- overflow
  - tells the browser what to do if the content in a box is bigger than said box
  - hidden: hides extra content
  - scroll: allows you to scroll the content of the box
- create borders
  - borders seperate boxes
  - every box has a border even if it isn't visible
  - set width by setting the whole border, or by setting individual sides
  - style: solid, dotted, dashed, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset, hidden/none
  - can also be assigned individually
  - color can be assigned to whole border or individual sides
  - shorthand: `border` allows you to style width, size, and color at the same time
- set margins & padding
  - padding sets how much space between content and it's border
  - can be set for individual sides or all sides at once
  - margin controls the gap between boxes
  - center content by setting left and right margins to auto
  - inline: causes a block to act like an inline element
  - block: causes an inline element to act like a block
  - inline-block: flow like an inline, maintain other features of a block
  - none: hides from the page
- show and hide
  - visibility element: hides boxes from users but leaves a space
  - hidden: hides the element
  - visible: shows the element
- rounded corners & eliptical shpaes
  - to get rounded corners use `border-radius: Apx, Bpx, Cpx, Dpx;` where A B C & D are top, right, bottom, and left corners respectively, or the same command specifying a specific corner
  - you can also specificy different distances for the horizontal and vertical parts of the rounded corners for more interesting shapes
  
  ## Decisions and Loops
  - Switch statements
   - switch value: variable that determines which case will run
   - includes a default statement which can make it more efficient than if/else statements
 - type coercion: javascript tries to convert data types behind the scene to complete an operation
 - weak typing: data type for a value can change
 - falsy values are treated as false but are not technically booleans
 - truthy values are treated as true but are not technically booleans
 - unary operator: returns a result iwth just one operand
 - short circuit values: logical operators "short circuit" (stop) when they have a result and return the value that stopped processing
