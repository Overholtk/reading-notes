## Links:
- created using the `<a>` element
- specify linked page with `href=`
-  relative URLS don't require the domain name because they are used for insite links
-  `mailto:` is used with `href` when you want the link to open the users email with an adress already filled in
- `target` attribute opens to a new page

## Layout
- CSS treats each HTML element as if they are in their own blocks
- inline boxes will appear on the same line
- block level boxes will appear on the next line
- normal flow: each block element will appear on a new line even if there is room on the same line, this is the default
- relative positioning: moves an element relative to where it would sit in normal flow
- absolute positioning: positions an element relative to it's containing element
- fixed positioning: absolute positioning that positions relevent to the browser window rather than containing element
- floating elements: takes the element out of normal flow entirely

## Functions, methods, and objects
- function is a group of code that can be called to perform the task it has been built to do
- when calling a function may need parameters, which are used to fill in variables in the function with information outside the function
- an anonymous function is a nameless function that takes the place of an expression
- variable scope: variables outside can be accessed from inside, but variables inside functions cannot be seen or read by the rest of the code
