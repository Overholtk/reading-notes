## Images

- Adjust multiple images at once by choosing three sizes (ex: small, medium, and large) and then assigning the relevent class to the image
- Aligning images all at once can be done by assigning them an align-left or align-right class
- Centering images can be done with `text-align: center` or the `margin` property on the individual image
- the `background image` property allows you to set an image to the background on the entire page or just part of the page
- Repeating images:
  - `repeat` repeated both horizontally and vertically
  - `repeat-x` repeated horizontally only
  - `repeat-y` repeated vertically only
  - `no-repeat` only shows once
  - `fixed` stays in the same position on the page
  - `scroll` background image moves up and down as the user scrolls
- `background position` determines where in the browser a background image should be placed as long as it is not repeating, and can use the following values:
  - `left top`
  - `left center`
  - `left bottom`
  - `left bottom`
  - `center top`
  - `center center`
  - `center bottom`
  - `right top`
  - `right center`
  - `right bottom`
- shortcut: `background` can take the following properties (in order):
  - `background-color`
  - `background-image`
  - `background-repeat`
  - `background-attachment`
  - `background-position`
- image rollovers: when a link or button changes style when a user hovers their mouse over it
  - set a background image for the link or button that has three different styles of the same button (w space only to show one at a time) 
- sprite: an image used in several different places on a page
  - loads faster than if it had to call multiple images
- gradient backgrounds are created using the `background-image` property
- Background image contrast: high contrast is difficult to read, use low contrast or include a screen over the image / under the text to improve readability
