## HTML

HTML describes the structure of pages using elements

### Tags
- Opening tags begin with a left angle bracket, followed by the character(s) in the tag you're using, then a right angle bracket
- Closing tags function roughly the same, but include a forward slash in front of the tag

### Attributes
- name: determines what kind of information
- value: contains the information

### Body, Head and Ttitle
- Head:
  - contains title and information about the page
  - title: the contents of the title are either shown in the top of the browser or in the tab
- Body:
  - everything inside the body is displayed on the webpage
  
  ## Extra Markup
  - Doctypes: tells the webpage which version of HTML is being used
  - comments are made using `<!-- comment here -->`
  - id attribute uniquely identifies one element
  - class attribute identifies several elements
  - block elements include `<h1>, <p>,<ul>, and <li>` and always start on a new line
  - inline elements continue on the same line adn include `<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>`
  - `<div>` groups a set of elements together in a block level box
  - `<span>` acts like the inline equivilent of the `<div>` element
  - `<iframe>`cuts from your page into another page
  - `<meta>` contains information about the webpage
  -
  
  ## HTML 5
  - Layout elements updated to be more descriptive
  - Headers and footers can be used for the very top & bottom of a page, and also for individual articles
  -  `<nav>` element contains major navigational blocks on the site
  - `<article>` contains any standalone section of a page
  - `<aside>` is used to contain information that is related to either a single article or the whole page
  - `<section>` groups related content together
  - `<hgroup>` groups heading elements together into one heading
  - `<figure>` can contain images and other content referenced, `<figcaption>` provides a caption for the figure

## Process and Design
## Page Structure

### Site Maps
A **site map** is a diagram of the pages a site will used.
  - Card Sorting is one way of organizing those pages, by writing necessary information on paper and sorthing them into groups.
  - When building a site map, start with the home page and then connect each subsequent page. Large sites may require secondary home pages for groups of related pages.
  
### Wireframes
A **wire frame** is a sketch of the key info delegated to each page.
  - a wireframe should include color scheme, fonts, backgrounds, images, and other important styling
 
### Effeciently Communicating Information
To get your message across clearly, information must be **organized** and **prioritized**
    
### Three ways to prioritize
- **Visual Hierarchy:** the order in which your eyes percieve what they see
- **Grouping:** placing relevent info together in a similar style
- **Similarity:** Everything is visually related, without becoming boring
  
### Navigation
Site navigation should be...
- Concise
- Clear
- Seletive
- Context
- Interactive
- Consistent

## Objects and Properties
- objects = things
- properties = characteristics

## Methods
- a method is a completed list of instructions that can be called upon

- window object: each window or tab
- document object: the file loaded into the window to display a web page
