# REST

- Roy Fielding: helped write the first web servers & helped determine why the web works the way it does

- HTTP: tells the browser what protocols to use

- Url points to a resource (conceptual), and then browser gets a specific representation of a resource

- redirect: sends you to get something from it's secondary location

- URL allows computers to communicate with each other across languages, databases, etc.

- "polymorphism": telling the computer what to do with the information stored in the url (ex: GET an image)
