## How computers work
- 4 core functions
  - Input
  - Storage
  - Processing
  - Output
  
Input:
- the external information the computer takes in 
- can be done in any number of ways
Storage:
- stores information in memory
Processing:
- uses an algorithm to process information, then re-stores
- continues the cycle until the information is ready to be output
Output:
- information is then displayed / is usable

Binary:
- wire can either be on or off, representing true or false, yes or no, or a 0 or 1
- bit = smallest piece of info storable
- more wires will compound to create more bits, eventually creating large chunks of information

Circuits:
- converts an electrical signal into computable information
- not circuits will flip info
- and circuits will give true or false if both signals are 1s
- add circuits combine information

CPU, memory, and output:
Parts of a computer
- Input device
  - keybord, touchpad, camera, mic, etc.
- memory
  - holds the information
- cpu
  - processes info
- output

Hardware and Software:
Hardware:
  - wires, plugs, etc.
Software:
  - coding, games, apps, etc.
  - tells the cpu what to do
  - 

CPU:
- master chip that controls the computer
- includes smaller simpler parts
  - circuits
  - recieves command and determines relevent circuits
  
OS:
- master program that manages how software uses the hardware
