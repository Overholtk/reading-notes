## Markdown
  
### What is Markdown?
   
   Markdown is a text styling syntax that can be used around github to present ideas in a visually appealing and easy to read way.
    
### Pros of markdown
  - [x] lightweight
  - [x] minimal special characters

### Using markdown
  **Headers** are availible in three sizes and are noted with the pound sign.
  # One pound sign produces the largest header
  ## Two for the medium
  ## And three for the smallest
  
  **Text Weight**
    *Italicize text by incasing it in one asterisk on either side, or one underscore on either side.*
    
   ex: ```*this is italic*``` or ```_this is italic_```
    
  **Bold text by using two asterisks on each side.**
  
   ex: ```**this is bolded**```
    
  **Lists*
  
  - Three kinds of lists are availible in markdown
  - This is an unordered list (bullet points, no rankings)
  - Unordered lists are created by placing a dash in front of each item on the list
  - ex ```- this is a list item```
  
  1. Ordered lists including rankings rather than bullet points.
  1. An ordered list is created by placing the number one with a period in front of each list item.
     1. A sub line of any item may be added by indenting the next line
  1. ex: ``` 1. This is a list item```
  
                ``` 1. This is it's sub item```
                
  - [x] Task lists allow you to mark items off a list
  - [x] Simply follow your dash by a set of brackets
  - [] When you want the item checked off, include an 'x' character inside the brackets
  - [] ex: `- [x] this is a checked box`
           `- [] this is a non checked box'
  
  
  **Images** can be added to a webpage by entering the text you want to represent it as well as the image's address into the following line of example code:

```![Text](Image Address or URL)```

If successful, the image should appear in text:

  **Links** are done in the same way, minus without the exclamation point at the beginning of the line. 
  
  > A **block quote** will indent and hilight an important piece of text. This is done by using a greater than sign in front of the text.
  
  ex: ``` > this is a quote from a famous person!```
  
  **Code Blocks** allow you to include bare code on your webpage without markdown translating it to edit text. You can achieve this by putting your code inside a set of apostraphies or indenting by four spaces.
  
  Tables can contain Data | That would otherwise be inconvenient to store
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  A pipe separates the two columns| And a row of hyphens separates headers from data
