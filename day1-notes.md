## Markdown
  
### What is Markdown?
   
   Markdown is a text styling syntax that can be used around github to present ideas in a visually appealing and easy to read way.
    
### Pros of markdown

  **Headers** are availible in three sizes and are noted with the pound sign.
  # One pound sign produces the largest header

  **Text Weight**
    *Italicize text by incasing it in one asterisk on either side, or one underscore on either side.*
    
   ex: ```*this is italic*``` or ```_this is italic_```
    
  **Bold text by using two asterisks on each side.**
  
   ex: ```**this is bolded**```
    
  **Lists*
  
  - Two kinds of lists are availible in markdown
  - This is an unordered list (bullet points, no rankings)
  - Unordered lists are created by placing a dash in front of each item on the list
  - ex ```- this is a list item```
  
  1. Ordered lists including rankings rather than bullet points.
  1. An ordered list is created by placing the number one with a period in front of each list item.
     1. A sub line of any item may be added by indenting the next line

                ``` 1. This is it's sub item```
