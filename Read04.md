# Structure Pages With HTML

## Page Structure

### Site Maps
A **site map** is a diagram of the pages a site will used.
  - Card Sorting is one way of organizing those pages, by writing necessary information on paper and sorthing them into groups.
  - When building a site map, start with the home page and then connect each subsequent page. Large sites may require secondary home pages for groups of related pages.
  
### Wireframes
A **wire frame** is a sketch of the key info delegated to each page.
  - a wireframe should include color scheme, fonts, backgrounds, images, and other important styling
 
### Effeciently Communicating Information
To get your message across clearly, information must be **organized** and **prioritized**
  - Organizing:
    - group together closely related content
    - purpose should be easy to identify
    - maintain consistent visual style
  - Prioritizing:
    - use distinct style to draw the eye to particular information
    
### Three ways to prioritize
- **Visual Hierarchy:** the order in which your eyes percieve what they see
  - created with contrast
  - Size: larger grabs attention first
  - Color: foreground vs. background color. brighter color grabs attention
- **Grouping:** placing relevent info together in a similar style
  - *Kinds of grouping:*
  - Proximity
  - Closure
  - Continuance
  - White Space
  - Color
  - Borders
- **Similarity:** Everything is visually related, without becoming boring
  - Consistency
  - Headings
  
### Navigation
Site navigation should be...
- Concise
- Clear
- Seletive
- Context
- Interactive
- Consistent

## HTML

HTML describes the structure of pages using elements

### Tags
- Opening tags begin with a left angle bracket, followed by the character(s) in the tag you're using, then a right angle bracket
- Closing tags function roughly the same, but include a forward slash in front of the tag

### Attributes
- name: determines what kind of information
- value: contains the information

### Body, Head and Ttitle
- Head:
  - contains title and information about the page
  - title: the contents of the title are either shown in the top of the browser or in the tab
- Body:
  - everything inside the body is displayed on the webpage
